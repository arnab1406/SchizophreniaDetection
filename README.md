• Pre-processed the EEG signals into corresponding TF Data Objects for facilitating the usage of TPUs
• Trained a custom Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory Network using TensorFlow to detect anomaly of the signals with an overall validation accuracy of 99%.
• Deployed interactive dashboard using Gradio to analyze segments of the signals for sudden disturbances occurring due to abruption in cognitive requirement of a task to be performed by the patient
